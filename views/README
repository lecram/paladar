Templates use the SimpleTemplate (or stpl) engine from bottle.py.
http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/stpl.html
The actual templates (*.tpl files) are generated by gentpl.py from pre-templates (*.ptp files).
Pre-templates include the [[*]] construct for localized strings.
All gentpl.py does is change every [[*]] to {{_(*)}}, converting *.ptp to *.tpl.
