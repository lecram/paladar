Every directory in this path, should have a proper code as its name.
The code is either ll or ll-CC, where:
  * ll is a two-letter lowercase ISO 639-1 language abbreviation [1];
  * CC is a two-letter uppercase ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code [2].

The file languages.json register the languages on the system, i.e. a language is visible to the system if and only if it's listed on languages.json.
Countries are identified on languages.json using country code top-level domains (ccTLD) [3].
